# weather-app

## Description

Creating a Weather application using APIs.

This challenge tasked us with creating a real-world example of a Weather application. This required us to use all skills acquired from the Bootcamp in the past 2 months.

This project was built to bring together all the knowledge learned thus far to create a dynamic system: HTML, Bootstrap, jQuery and APIs.

The Weather application helps inform the user of current and upcoming weather reports. A user may be inclined to such an app in preparation of travel to different locations, or to perform local duties.

I learned how to create web applications using API's and different libraries.

## Installation

Clone the repo onto your local machine and run it offline or visit the page:
https://dariams1.github.io/weather-app/

## Usage

Enter any city name into the search bar and check out the 5 day weather forecast!

## Credits

I have worked on this project with 2 other people at the time it was introduced and copied the start of the code and finished it off. This created issues as I didn't realise I was working on a cloned repo that was not my own (didn't push, phew!) so I am missing some commits. I copied and pasted what was there onto here, so there's only 1 commit.
