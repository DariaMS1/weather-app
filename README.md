# weather-app
Creating a Weather application using APIs.

This challenge tasked us with creating a real-world example of a Weather application. This required us to use all skills acquired from the Bootcamp in the past 2 months.

This project was built to bring together all the knowledge learned thus far to create a dynamic system: HTML, Bootstrap, jQuery and APIs.

The Weather application helps inform the user of current and upcoming weather reports. A user may be inclined to such an app in preparation of travel to different locations, or to perform local duties.
